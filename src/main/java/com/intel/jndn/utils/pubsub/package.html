<p>See [need link here] for algorithm details.</p>

<p>The NDN pub-sub algorithm is designed using the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>subscriber-driven</li>
  <li>lightweight</li>
  <li>avoid unnecessary IO</li>
</ul>

<p>It makes the following guarantees:</p>
<ul>
  <li>each publisher will order its own messages by the order in which they were published; however, the mechanism
    for this ordering (i.e. a monotonically-increasing ID) will not maintain the guarantee across multiple
    publishers (in this case, an application-level mechanism, like a time-synchronized timestamp, must be used;
    alternatively, try ChronoSync)
  </li>
  <li>publishers will provide the messages published on a topic for a specified lifetime; even after being closed,
    the publisher must maintain a registered prefix and respond to subscriber requests for data
  </li>
  <li>subscribers will eventually discover all routable publishers</li>
</ul>

<p>Known limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>different faces must be used for each subscriber/publisher; the reason for this is that an interest sent on
    a face will not be re-expressed back to itself by the NFD
  </li>
</ul>
